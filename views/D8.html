<h2 class="project-name"> D8 Web App </h2>

<p class="project-description">
<span>
D8 is a simple web app to adress a complex question, "where are you gonna take your date tonight?"
<br>
<br>

Built with a front end first design, our web app uses tried and tested internet technologies to match our users with the activities they'll love.
<br>
<br>

Utilizing a thorough personality survey based on real psychological principles, our algorithim matches each user with the most optimal restaurant and movie options for their personality type.

As part of a team of four my work consisted of:
<br>
<br>
1. Designing a scalable structure for API calls such that the user's time is prioritized and they do not have to spend seconds waiting for the results to load.
<br>
<br>
2. Communicating with the design team on a consistent basis to make sure that both teams are working toward the same common goal.
<br>
<br>
3. Implementing interactivity to the components of the web app through pair programming in order to ensure that the entire team understands the codebase.</span>
